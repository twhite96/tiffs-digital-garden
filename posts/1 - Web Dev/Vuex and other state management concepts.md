Some interesting tidbits

> It is a self-contained app with the following parts:

-   The **state**, the source of truth that drives our app; ^b0a65a
-   The **view**, a declarative mapping of the **state**;
-   The **actions**, the possible ways the state could change in reaction to user inputs from the **view**.

This is a simple representation of the concept of "one way data flow", [[1 - Web Dev/Two-Way Data Binding#What is Two-Way Data binding|the opposite of which is 2-way data binding]]

However, the simplicity quickly breaks down when we have **multiple components that share a common state**:

-   Multiple views may depend on the same piece of state.
-   Actions from different views may need to mutate the same piece of state.

For problem one, [[1 - Web Dev/Prop Drilling#What is prop drilling|passing props can be tedious for deeply nested components, and simply doesn't work for sibling components]]. For problem two, we often find ourselves resorting to solutions such as reaching for direct parent/child instance references or trying to mutate and synchronize multiple copies of the state via events. Both of these patterns are brittle and quickly lead to unmaintainable code.
